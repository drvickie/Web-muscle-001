    <h3>Commenting in HTML</h3>
    <p>
        A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->.
        Commenting allows you to leave messages to explain the codes or pay closer attention where needed.
        Any of the comments will not display with the contents on the browser.
        Commenting can also allow you to make codes inactive.
        Try out some examples.
    </p>
    <h3>Nesting in HTML</h3>
    <p>Nesting in HTML is when one HTML element is placed inside another HTML element. 
       This allows for multiple HTML tags to be applied to the same content. 
       Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. 
       This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.
